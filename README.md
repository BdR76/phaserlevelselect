Level select
==============
This is a html5/javascript example of how to do a typical level select or stage selection screen using the Phaser framework.

Level select screen like in Angry Birds or Cut The Rope are very common, a lot of web and mobile games use them.

This example has a 3x4 grid of icons representing the levels, each with a level number and a stars icon to indicate how well the player has finished a level. Players can tap on an icon to select a level. It contains graphics taken from Cut The Rope and an ugly font, but it's just an example of the code.
